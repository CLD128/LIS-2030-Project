They include correspondence with or about his family and friends on non-public topics, and papers relating to his personal, financial and legal affairs, and his social life. For the purposes of this arrangement, his activities in the Regular and Territorial Armies, in Cuba and during the Boer War in South Africa, and as a painter, have been regarded as personal. For the period 1940-1945 material of a personal nature in this sense can also be found in the Private Office (CHAR 20) and Personal Office (CHAR 2) correspondence series which were left largely undisturbed in the new arrangement. Receipts for personal expenditure incurred in his constituencies are placed in this class except those which are noted as belonging to the 'Dundee Fund', and, similarly, some expenditure of a personal kind was originally treated as literary expenses and the documents appear in CHAR 8.0 aOnline resource; description from web page and publisher data (viewed on 4 November 2019).10aChurchill, Winston,d1874-1965vArchives. 0aPrime ministerszGreat BritainvArchives. 0aSouth African War, 1899-1902vSources. 0aGreat BritainxHistoryvSources.17aChurchill, Winston,d1874-19652fast0(OCoLC)fst0171687627aSouth African War (1899-1902)2fast0(OCoLC)fst01127143 7a1899-19022fast 7aPrime ministers.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01076416 7aGreat Britain.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01204623 7aArchives.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01423700 7aHistory.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01411628 7aSources.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01423900 0aBoer War (1899-1902)12iContainer of (work):aChurchill, Winston,d1874-1965.tCorrespondence.40uhttp://www.churchillarchive.com/explore/catalogue?id=CHAR%201  aChurchill Archive03858nam a2200397ki 4500001001400000003000700014006001900021007001800040008004100058040002900099043001200128090002400140100004600164245007800210246005600288264009600344300003900440336002600479336003300505337002600538338003600564520220200600588009502802600004602897650004602943651003702989600006103026650004703087651004503134655004003179655003903219655003903258700007503297856006603372975002203438CDCWSCCHAR002UkLoBPm     o  d          acbrdcenhm191104s2012    enka    o     000 0deng d  aUkLoBPbengerdacUkLoBP  ae-uk---  aDA566.9.C5bA2 20121 aChurchill, Winston,d1874-1965,ecreator.10aChurchill Archive :bCHAR 2 : Public and Political : general (1898-1945).30aCHAR 2 : Public and Political : general (1898-1945) 1aLondon :bBloomsbury Publishing in collaboration with the Churchill Archives Centre,c2012.  a1 online resource :billustrations  atextbtxt2rdacontent  astill imagebsti2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aThe papers in this class relate to WSC's activities as a person in public life other than those as MP for a particular constituency or as a Minister, and the class inevitably forms a miscellany of papers of widely differing kinds and value. They include notes and correspondence with colleagues, acquaintances, and the general public, on topics of contemporary general interest, on party political matters, and on appointments to various positions, together with invitations to speak at meetings and multifarious letters from members of the public drawn to write to an influential public figure. In particular it should be noted that the class includes papers relating to governmental business with which WSC was not at the relevant time concerned as Minister of a Department or a member of the Cabinet; notable examples occur in 1916 in connection with the Dardanelles Commission of Inquiry, and 1930-39 in connection with India and defence matters, except where the latter concerned him as a member of the Air Defence Research Committee of the Committe of Imperial Defence. The class also includes the papers kept by the Personal Office during World War II. This Office, as opposed to the Private Office, dealt with non-official matters but the distinction is not drawn very clearly and the difference is largely one of administration. While the Personal Office material, viewed as a whole, falls naturally into this class, there are numerous individual items which would in other circumstances have been placed elsewhere, particularly in Personal (CHAR 1). The main series of Personal Office correspondence was known at the time as P(rivate?) and P(ersonal?). It includes some correspondence on gifts made or offered to WSC, although there was also a series know as Gifts which dealt with this topic and has been preserved. Similarly, although there is a series called General Public (formerly Ordinaries), much correspondence from the general public is to be found in the main correspondence series. The Patronage series concerns the activities of WSC as patron or member of, or subscriber to various associations and institutions. There are also files of congratulations on various occasions.0 aOnline resource; description from web page and publisher data (viewed on 4 November 2019).10aChurchill, Winston,d1874-1965vArchives. 0aPrime ministerszGreat BritainvArchives. 0aGreat BritainxHistoryvSources.17aChurchill, Winston,d1874-19652fast0(OCoLC)fst01716876 7aPrime ministers.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01076416 7aGreat Britain.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01204623 7aArchives.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01423700 7aHistory.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01411628 7aSources.2fast0(OCoLC)fst0142390012iContainer of (work):aChurchill, Winston,d1874-1965.tCorrespondence.40uhttp://www.churchillarchive.com/explore/catalogue?id=CHAR%202  aChurchill Archive03020nam a2200505ki 4500001001400000003000700014006001900021007001800040008004100058040002900099043002100128090002400149100004600173245009400219246007200313264009600385300003900481336002600520336003300546337002600579338003600605520100000641588009501641600004601736650004601782651004001828651003701868600006101905650004701966651004702013651004502060655004002105655003902145655003902184653001502223653001502238653001602253653002202269653001702291653002502308653001802333700007502351856006602426975002202492CDCWSCCHAR003UkLoBPm     o  d          acbrdcenhm191104s2012    enka    o     000 0deng d  aUkLoBPbengerdacUkLoBP  ae-uk---ae-uk-en  aDA566.9.C5bA2 20121 aChurchill, Winston,d1874-1965,ecreator.10aChurchill Archive :bCHAR 3 : Political : Constituency : Oldham [Lancashire] (1900-1905).30aCHAR 3 : Political : Constituency : Oldham [Lancashire] (1900-1905) 1aLondon :bBloomsbury Publishing in collaboration with the Churchill Archives Centre,c2012.  a1 online resource :billustrations  atextbtxt2rdacontent  astill imagebsti2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aThis class of papers covers WSC's time as Conservative MP for Oldham (1900 - 1906). The papers contain correspondence with local Conservative Association officers discussing constituency affairs. There are also large numbers of letters from constituents and local institutions asking WSC for his support and patronage. Oldham was WSC's first parliamentary seat and the papers include letters of congratulation from many of the prominent figures of the day (see CHAR 3/1). The single issue that dominated this phase of WSC's career was his breach with the local and national Conservative party over his support for Free Trade. Other national topics which are represented in these papers include education, the Licensing Bill and Trade Union law. WSC ceased to be the official Conservative party candidate in Jan 1904 following a vote of no confidence by the local association. He remained as MP for Oldham until Jan 1906 when he successfully contested Manchester North West for the Liberal Party.0 aOnline resource; description from web page and publisher data (viewed on 4 November 2019).10aChurchill, Winston,d1874-1965vArchives. 0aPrime ministerszGreat BritainvArchives. 0aOldham (England)xHistoryvSources. 0aGreat BritainxHistoryvSources.17aChurchill, Winston,d1874-19652fast0(OCoLC)fst01716876 7aPrime ministers.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01076416 7aEnglandzOldham.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01227523 7aGreat Britain.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01204623 7aArchives.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01423700 7aHistory.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01411628 7aSources.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01423900 0aEducation. 0aElections. 0aFree trade. 0aLabour relations. 0aLegislation. 0aPolitical patronage. 0aTrade unions.12iContainer of (work):aChurchill, Winston,d1874-1965.tCorrespondence.40uhttp://www.churchillarchive.com/explore/catalogue?id=CHAR%203  aChurchill Archive02957nam a2200517ki 4500001001400000003000700014006001900021007001800040008004100058040002900099043002100128090002400149100004600173245009600219246007400315264009600389300003900485336002600524336003300550337002600583338003600609520090000645588009501545600004601640650004601686651005201732651003701784600006101821650004701882651006501929651004501994655004002039655003902079655003902118653001702157653001502174653001602189653001602205653001702221653001402238653001102252653001302263700007502276856006602351975002202417CDCWSCCHAR004UkLoBPm     o  d          acbrdcenhm191104s2012    enka    o     000 0deng d  aUkLoBPbengerdacUkLoBP  ae-uk---ae-uk-en  aDA566.9.C5bA2 20121 aChurchill, Winston,d1874-1965,ecreator.10aChurchill Archive :bCHAR 4 : Political : Constituency : North West Manchester (1904-1908).30aCHAR 4 : Political : Constituency : North West Manchester (1904-1908) 1aLondon :bBloomsbury Publishing in collaboration with the Churchill Archives Centre,c2012.  a1 online resource :billustrations  atextbtxt2rdacontent  astill imagebsti2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aThis class of papers covers WSC's time as Liberal MP for North West Manchester (1906 to 1908).

The file on the Westminster campaign (CHAR 6/2) contains letters from many prominent public and political figures.0 aOnline resource; description from web page and publisher data (viewed on 4 November 2019).10aChurchill, Winston,d1874-1965vArchives. 0aPrime ministerszGreat BritainvArchives. 0aLeicestershire (England)xHistoryvSources. 0aWestminster (London, England)xHistoryvSources. 0aGreat BritainxHistoryvSources.17aChurchill, Winston,d1874-19652fast0(OCoLC)fst01716876 7aPrime ministers.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01076416 7aEnglandzLeicestershire.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01202857 7aEnglandzLondonzWestminster.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01312768 7aGreat Britain.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01204623 7aArchives.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01423700 7aHistory.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01411628 7aSources.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01423900 0aElections.12iContainer of (work):aChurchill, Winston,d1874-1965.tCorrespondence.40uhttp://www.churchillarchive.com/explore/catalogue?id=CHAR%206  aChurchill Archive03870nam a2200541ki 4500001001400000003000700014006001900021007001800040008004100058040002900099043002100128090002400149100004600173245008900219246006700308264009600375300003900471336002600510336003300536337002600569338003600595520163700631588009502268600004602363650004602409651004002455651003902495651003702534600006102571650004702632651004702679651004602726651004502772655004002817655003902857655003902896653003102935653001902966653001502985653002003000653001403020653003303034653003003067653006803097700007503165856006603240975002203306CDCWSCCHAR007UkLoBPm     o  d          acbrdcenhm191104s2012    enka    o     000 0deng d  aUkLoBPbengerdacUkLoBP  ae-uk---ae-uk-en  aDA566.9.C5bA2 20121 aChurchill, Winston,d1874-1965,ecreator.10aChurchill Archive :bCHAR 7 : Political : Constituency : Epping [Essex] (1924-1945).30aCHAR 7 : Political : Constituency : Epping [Essex] (1924-1945) 1aLondon :bBloomsbury Publishing in collaboration with the Churchill Archives Centre,c2012.  a1 online resource :billustrations  atextbtxt2rdacontent  astill imagebsti2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aThis class of papers covers that part of WSC's time as Conservative MP for Epping contained in the Chartwell papers (up to 26 July 1945). The remainder of his time as MP (for Woodford) can be found in the post-1945 Churchill papers at CHUR 3. The papers contain correspondence between WSC's office and local officials, particularly the Vice-Chairman of Epping Division Conservative Association, Sir James Hawkey, discussing standard constituency business (such as WSC's support for various local associations and events). Additionally, they contain many letters from constituents asking for WSC's assistance over pensions, employment and other such personal matters. There are also enquiries on a range of local concerns, including wartime issues such as ARP, evacuation, rationing, the call-up, bomb damage and resulting housing shortages. The predominant national topics of the period (the India White Paper, the economy, the abdication of Edward VIII, the rise of the Fascist Powers, attitudes towards the League of Nations, the policy of appeasement, etc.) are also represented in the papers. Furthermore, there is material concerning tensions in the Constituency Association over WSC's criticism of the National Government during the thirties. The correspondence files are generally arranged alphabetically according to the surname of the correspondent, though on occasions letters on a particular subject (i.e. vivisection) have been filed together. Up till 1940 the correspondence files are arranged by year. However, the material for 1940-1945 has been filed together and then subdivided alphabetically for the whole period.0 aOnline resource; description from web page and publisher data (viewed on 4 November 2019).10aChurchill, Winston,d1874-1965vArchives. 0aPrime ministerszGreat BritainvArchives. 0aEpping (England)xHistoryvSources. 0aEssex (England)xHistoryvSources. 0aGreat BritainxHistoryvSources.17aChurchill, Winston,d1874-19652fast0(OCoLC)fst01716876 7aPrime ministers.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01076416 7aEnglandzEpping.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01222801 7aEnglandzEssex.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01212484 7aGreat Britain.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01204623 7aArchives.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01423700 7aHistory.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01411628 7aSources.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01423900 0aAbdication of Edward VIII. 0aCivil defence. 0aElections. 0aForeign policy. 0aMonarchy. 0aSecond World War (1939-1945) 0aWar devastated countries. 1aEdward VIII (1894-1972), King of Great Britain, United Kingdom.12iContainer of (work):aChurchill, Winston,d1874-1965.tCorrespondence.40uhttp://www.churchillarchive.com/explore/catalogue?id=CHAR%207  aChurchill Archive05534nam a2200421ki 4500001001400000003000700014006001900021007001800040008004100058040002900099043002100128090002400149100004600173245005600219246003400275264009600309300003900405336002600444336003300470337002600503338003600529520377900565588009504344600004604439650004604485651003704531600006104568650004704629651004504676655004004721655003904761655003904800653001604839653009404855700007504949856006605024975002205090CDCWSCCHAR008UkLoBPm     o  d          acbrdcenhm191104s2012    enka    o     000 0deng d  aUkLoBPbengerdacUkLoBP  ae-uk---ae-uk-en  aDA566.9.C5bA2 20121 aChurchill, Winston,d1874-1965,ecreator.10aChurchill Archive :bCHAR 8 : Literary (1890-1945).30aCHAR 8 : Literary (1890-1945) 1aLondon :bBloomsbury Publishing in collaboration with the Churchill Archives Centre,c2012.  a1 online resource :billustrations  atextbtxt2rdacontent  astill imagebsti2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aThis class contains correspondence with publishers, editors, and printers, and other correspondence in connection with WSC's literary work both during preparation and after publication. Since some of the publications are political there is a little correspondence on political topics which arises directly and obviously out of publications. The class also contains materials assembled for writing, notes and drafts, printer's copy, proofs, and reviews. Often some of the material assembled was not used in the final work, while other material was clearly acquired after publication and preserved either out of interest or with a view to later editions. No rigid line can be drawn between source-material and correspondence with persons whose help and advice was sought by WSC, nor on the other hand between source-material and copy, since original documents or parts of them were sent as 'author's copy' to the printer. Such copy still includes documents which may well belong in some other class but are too mutilated to be usefully returned, even if their provenance is certain. Generally, however, documents which could have been acquired in some other connection than the collection of source material, for example in virtue of office, have been placed in the presumed original class, except in cases where it is certain that they were acquired for literary purposes and can conveniently be separated from other material of less certain provenance, or where they have been inseparably attached to literary material. The material present for all these reasons in CHAR 8 is occasionally of some importance and the value of this class as a source for non-literary matters must not be overlooked. The correspondence is arranged chronologically; the book matter is grouped at the date, or estimated date, of publication, except for "The history of the English Speaking Peoples", which was largely completed before World War II though not published until later. It has been placed at the end of the class followed by some files of correspondence which came to light only after the arrangement had been completed. Where books contain a number of volumes all the matter is placed at the date of the first volume. It should be noted, in connection with the use of chapter titles to distinguish some book-matter files, that titles might be changed and chapters re-arranged in the course of preparation, so that these descriptions must be used with some care. Articles were frequently syndicated and reprinted, often under different titles. Where a book consists of a collection of previously published articles the text of an article may only be found in the book, but in some other cases an article may become separated and restored to the date of the original publication. The book eventually called "Great Contemporaries" started life as a collection of reprinted articles called "Short Biographies" in 1932. The "Biographies" were not published then but some articles appeared in "Thoughts and Adventures". Both "Short Biographies" and "Great Contemporaries" were used as titles by the printers on the galley proofs of other articles set up in the expectation that they would become separate books or be added to the second edition of "Great Contemporaries". All this matter has been placed at 1937. "Not Uneventful" was the title proposed for an autobiography compiled by Charles Eade from WSC's published writings. The copy of "The history of the English Speaking Peoples" is numbered in folios. The numeration reflects neither chronological arrangement nor the order of the book. It may well not reflect the order in which the various parts were prepared, but shows the order in which they were first printed, and the first galley proofs bear the appropriate folio numbers.0 aOnline resource; description from web page and publisher data (viewed on 4 November 2019).10aChurchill, Winston,d1874-1965vArchives. 0aPrime ministerszGreat BritainvArchives. 0aGreat BritainxHistoryvSources.17aChurchill, Winston,d1874-19652fast0(OCoLC)fst01716876 7aPrime ministers.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01076416 7aGreat Britain.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01204623 7aArchives.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01423700 7aHistory.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01411628 7aSources.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01423900 0aLiterature. 1aChurchill, Sir Winston Leonard Spencer (1874-1965), Knight, statesman and Prime Minister.12iContainer of (work):aChurchill, Winston,d1874-1965.tCorrespondence.40uhttp://www.churchillarchive.com/explore/catalogue?id=CHAR%208  aChurchill Archive02964nam a2200421ki 4500001001400000003000700014006001900021007001800040008004100058040002900099043001200128090002400140100004600164245005600210246003400266264009600300300003900396336002600435336003300461337002600494338003600520520122600556588009501782600004601877650004601923651003701969600006102006650004702067651004502114655004002159655003902199655003902238653001402277653009402291700006902385856006602454975002202520CDCWSCCHAR009UkLoBPm     o  d          acbrdcenhm191104s2012    enka    o     000 0deng d  aUkLoBPbengerdacUkLoBP  ae-uk---  aDA566.9.C5bA2 20121 aChurchill, Winston,d1874-1965,ecreator.10aChurchill Archive :bCHAR 9 : Speeches (1897-1945).30aCHAR 9 : Speeches (1897-1945) 1aLondon :bBloomsbury Publishing in collaboration with the Churchill Archives Centre,c2012.  a1 online resource :billustrations  atextbtxt2rdacontent  astill imagebsti2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aThe papers in this class have been assigned as far as possible to particular speeches, but certain papers remain unassignable, partly because notes and material were used for more than one occasion and partly because of inextricable confusion. The class includes material for speeches which is not unlike some of the papers in CHAR 2 (Public and Political: General) and CHAR 8 (Literary) classes, together with notes, drafts, speaking notes, press releases, press cuttings, Hansard, copies from Hansard and the press, and prints. Some of the texts have been prepared for the printers. Originally the material for each speech was contained in its individual envelope. For conservation reasons, the papers have now been taken out, and the empty envelopes placed at the beginning of each speech. In 1963 the Chartwell Trust received from the Prime Minister's Private Office a number of files consisting mainly of speech material, 1940-45. These files have been added at the end of this class and are indexed in PREM 4/102-135. Where WSC's speeches have been published in Robert Rhodes James' "Winston S Churchill: His Complete Speeches, 1897-1963" the publication details have been included in the description of the speech.0 aOnline resource; description from web page and publisher data (viewed on 4 November 2019).10aChurchill, Winston,d1874-1965vArchives. 0aPrime ministerszGreat BritainvArchives. 0aGreat BritainxHistoryvSources.17aChurchill, Winston,d1874-19652fast0(OCoLC)fst01716876 7aPrime ministers.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01076416 7aGreat Britain.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01204623 7aArchives.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01423700 7aHistory.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01411628 7aSources.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01423900 0aSpeeches. 1aChurchill, Sir Winston Leonard Spencer (1874-1965), Knight, statesman and Prime Minister.12iContainer of (work):aChurchill, Winston,d1874-1965.tSpeeches.40uhttp://www.churchillarchive.com/explore/catalogue?id=CHAR%209  aChurchill Archive03029nam a2200421ki 4500001001400000003000700014006001900021007001800040008004100058040002900099043001200128090002400140100004600164245007500210246005300285264009600338300003900434336002600473336003300499337002600532338003600558520132000594588009501914600004602009650004602055651003702101600006102138650004702199651004502246655004002291655003902331655003902370653001702409653001802426700007502444856006602519975002202585CDCWSCCHAR010UkLoBPm     o  d          acbrdcenhm191104s2012    enka    o     000 0deng d  aUkLoBPbengerdacUkLoBP  ae-uk---  aDA566.9.C5bA2 20121 aChurchill, Winston,d1874-1965,ecreator.10aChurchill Archive :bCHAR 10 : Official : Colonial Office (1902-1908).30aCHAR 10 : Official : Colonial Office (1902-1908) 1aLondon :bBloomsbury Publishing in collaboration with the Churchill Archives Centre,c2012.  a1 online resource :billustrations  atextbtxt2rdacontent  astill imagebsti2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aThe Colonial Office papers contain correspondence, printed material and papers which were created or accumulated as a result of WSC's activities as Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies, a position held from December 1905 to April 1908.

The material contains correspondence with senior Admiralty figures, politicians including the Prime Minister, public and foreign figures on subjects including naval strategy and engagements, armament production, merchant shipping, and more general political considerations. It also contains material about the Dardanelles Expedition, the scheme for the combined naval and military attack on the Gallipoli Peninsula against the Turkish empire which was intended to relieve pressure on Russia and persuade the Balkan states to join the Allies against Germany. Arrangement: However much material relating to WSC's first term as First Lord of the Admiralty will be found in the material about the Dardanelles Commission of Inquiry in Chartwell 2 (Public and Political: General) and it is also possible that material which was printed for the use of the Commission has been placed within this class. Similarly other papers were acquired after the First World War for WSC's history "The World Crisis" but they have been placed in the Admiralty papers because of the difficulty of making the distinction. Files CHAR 13/43, CHAR 13/44 and CHAR 13/45 were found in the Cabinet Offices in 1962. They are of the same character for the most part as the other papers in this class, but because of their long separation have been kept as they were found; other similar papers not having the same connection with WSC which were found at the same time have been placed in the Cabinet Class held at the Public Record Office, Ruskin Avenue, Kew, Surrey.0 aOnline resource; description from web page and publisher data (viewed on 4 November 2019).10aChurchill, Winston,d1874-1965vArchives. 0aPrime ministerszGreat BritainvArchives. 0aGreat BritainxHistoryvSources.17aChurchill, Winston,d1874-19652fast0(OCoLC)fst01716876 7aPrime ministers.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01076416 7aGreat Britain.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01204623 7aArchives.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01423700 7aHistory.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01411628 7aSources.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01423900 0aDardanelles campaign (1915-1916) 0aFirst World War (1914-1918) 0aMilitary equipment. 0aSea transport.12iContainer of (work):aChurchill, Winston,d1874-1965.tCorrespondence.40uhttp://www.churchillarchive.com/explore/catalogue?id=CHAR%213  aChurchill Archive02079nam a2200421ki 4500001001400000003000700014006001900021007001800040008004100058040002900099043002100128090002400149100004600173245007300219246005100292264009600343300003900439336002600478336003300504337002600537338003600563520029200599588009500891600004600986650004601032651005101078651003701129600006101166650004701227651005701274651004501331655004001376655003901416655003901455700007501494856006601569975002201635CDCWSCCHAR014UkLoBPm     o  d          acbrdcenhm191104s2012    enka    o     000 0deng d  aUkLoBPbengerdacUkLoBP  ae-uk---ae-uk-en  aDA566.9.C5bA2 20121 aChurchill, Winston,d1874-1965,ecreator.10aChurchill Archive :bCHAR 14 : Official : Duchy of Lancaster (1915).30aCHAR 14 : Official : Duchy of Lancaster (1915) 1aLondon :bBloomsbury Publishing in collaboration with the Churchill Archives Centre,c2012.  a1 online resource :billustrations  atextbtxt2rdacontent  astill imagebsti2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aThe Duchy of Lancaster papers contain a small amount of correspondence relating to WSC's brief period as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, a position which he held from 25 May to 25 November 1915.

The papers are not arranged chronologically, but in groups. Under WSC the Ministry was re-organised into ten divisions, each represented on the Munitions Council and identified with a single letter. This pattern provided a natural method of arranging the bulk of the records, but a degree of overlap between the divisions was unavoidable. The Ministry was organised as follows: A Allies or Air D Inventions and Design E Engineering, including tanks F Finance G Guns L Labour M Materials P (also ) O Projectiles R Requirements and Statistics S Steel and Iron X Explosives Chemical Warfare, which had a very varied existence, has been arranged separately The general outline of the arrangement of the class is: 1. Papers relating to subjects or bodies within or attached to the Ministry but outside the alphabetical divisions, including those relating to the period before WSC's appointment (Files 1-29); 2. Papers relating to external bodies (Files 30-39); 3. The Munitions Council (Files 40-47); 4. The Divisions in alphabetical order (Files 48-154); 5. An incomplete set of the Minister's registered correspondence and minutes, which came to light after the arrangement had been completed.0 aOnline resource; description from web page and publisher data (viewed on 4 November 2019).10aChurchill, Winston,d1874-1965vArchives. 0aPrime ministerszGreat BritainvArchives. 0aGreat BritainxHistoryvSources.17aChurchill, Winston,d1874-19652fast0(OCoLC)fst01716876 7aPrime ministers.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01076416 7aGreat Britain.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01204623 7aArchives.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01423700 7aHistory.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01411628 7aSources.2fast0(OCoLC)fst0142390012iContainer of (work):aChurchill, Winston,d1874-1965.tCorrespondence.40uhttp://www.churchillarchive.com/explore/catalogue?id=CHAR%215  aChurchill Archive03528nam a2200469ki 4500001001400000003000700014006001900021007001800040008004100058040002900099043001200128090002400140100004600164245007100210246004900281264009600330300003900426336002600465336003300491337002600524338003600550520171200586588009502298600004602393650004602439651003702485600006102522650004702583651004502630655004002675655003902715655003902754653001702793653001802810653002002828653001502848653002002863653001202883700007502895856006602970975002203036CDCWSCCHAR016UkLoBPm     o  d          acbrdcenhm191104s2012    enka    o     000 0deng d  aUkLoBPbengerdacUkLoBP  ae-uk---  aDA566.9.C5bA2 20121 aChurchill, Winston,d1874-1965,ecreator.10aChurchill Archive :bCHAR 16 : Official : War and Air (1918-1921).30aCHAR 16 : Official : War and Air (1918-1921) 1aLondon :bBloomsbury Publishing in collaboration with the Churchill Archives Centre,c2012.  a1 online resource :billustrations  atextbtxt2rdacontent  astill imagebsti2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aThe War and Air papers contain correspondence, minutes, printed material and other papers which were created or accumulated as a result of WSC's activities as Secretary of State for War and Air, positions he held concurrently from January 1919 to February 1921 (he continued as Secretary of State for Air while Secretary of State for the Colonies until April 1921). The papers have been divided into correspondence, WSC's outgoing minutes, and subject-based files and are arranged chronologically. The War and Air material covers WSC's routine ministerial duties as Secretary of State as well as specific issues of the period including: the demobilisation of British troops following the end of World War I; the reorganisation of the Air Ministry; Britain's involvement in the Russian Civil War and the related conflict between Russia and Poland; the fear of the spread of Bolshevism; matters discussed at the Paris [France] Peace Conference; British military control in the middle east, particularly concerning Mesopotamia [later Iraq]; military activity in Ireland. The material contains correspondence with WSC's ministerial colleagues and senior military figures of the day, such as General Sir Henry Wilson [Chief of Imperial General Staff]. It contains much addressed to WSC's deputy Sir Archibald Sinclair [later 1st Lord Thurso, Personal Military Secretary to the Secretary State for War] and there are several files devoted to information sent by Brigadier-General Edward Spears and the British Military Mission in Paris. There are also a number of files of intelligence reports, as well as several folios in assorted files, which remain closed and have been removed on Cabinet Office instructions.0 aOnline resource; description from web page and publisher data (viewed on 4 November 2019).10aChurchill, Winston,d1874-1965vArchives. 0aPrime ministerszGreat BritainvArchives. 0aGreat BritainxHistoryvSources.17aChurchill, Winston,d1874-19652fast0(OCoLC)fst01716876 7aPrime ministers.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01076416 7aGreat Britain.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01204623 7aArchives.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01423700 7aHistory.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01411628 7aSources.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01423900 0aAir warfare. 0aArmed forces. 0aCivil aviation. 0aCommunism. 0aForeign policy. 5aRussia.12iContainer of (work):aChurchill, Winston,d1874-1965.tCorrespondence.40uhttp://www.churchillarchive.com/explore/catalogue?id=CHAR%216  aChurchill Archive03275nam a2200409ki 4500001001400000003000700014006001900021007001800040008004100058040002900099043001200128090002400140100004600164245007500210246005300285264009600338300003900434336002600473336003300499337002600532338003600558520159600594588009502190600004602285650004602331651003702377600006102414650004702475651004502522655004002567655003902607655003902646653001702685700007502702856006602777975002202843CDCWSCCHAR017UkLoBPm     o  d          acbrdcenhm191104s2012    enka    o     000 0deng d  aUkLoBPbengerdacUkLoBP  ae-uk---  aDA566.9.C5bA2 20121 aChurchill, Winston,d1874-1965,ecreator.10aChurchill Archive :bCHAR 17 : Official : Colonial Office (1920-1922).30aCHAR 17 : Official : Colonial Office (1920-1922) 1aLondon :bBloomsbury Publishing in collaboration with the Churchill Archives Centre,c2012.  a1 online resource :billustrations  atextbtxt2rdacontent  astill imagebsti2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aThe Colonial Office papers contain correspondence, printed material and papers which were created or accumulated as a result of WSC's activities as Secretary of State for the Colonies, a position he held from 13 February 1921 to 24 October 1922.

The Colonial Office material covers WSC's routine ministerial duties as well as with the specific issues of the period including: administration of the Middle East through the Middle East department set up by WSC; the installation of Emir Feisal as ruler of Mesopotamia [later Iraq]; the establishment of Palestine as a National Home for the Jews; negotiations in the Middle East through T E Lawrence [later T E Shaw, "Lawrence of Arabia"] and Sir Percy Cox [High Commissioner, Mesopotamia]; the reduction of the cost of the administration of the Middle East; the Irish Peace Settlement; the racial segregation of Indians; and British policy towards Turkey. General reports of events throughout the British empire shed light on the working of the relationship between Great Britain and the empire and include complaints from Dominion governors on the personal financial difficulties of maintaining their positions and on the proposed discontinuing of the ANZAC day message from King George V. The papers also include regular bulletins to the Dominions on the crisis in Chanak [later Cannakkale, Turkey] in which the British government took a military stand against Turkey and unsuccessfully requested forces from the Dominion governments.0 aOnline resource; description from web page and publisher data (viewed on 4 November 2019).10aChurchill, Winston,d1874-1965vArchives. 0aPrime ministerszGreat BritainvArchives. 0aGreat BritainxHistoryvSources.17aChurchill, Winston,d1874-19652fast0(OCoLC)fst01716876 7aPrime ministers.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01076416 7aGreat Britain.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01204623 7aArchives.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01423700 7aHistory.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01411628 7aSources.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01423900 0aColonialism.12iContainer of (work):aChurchill, Winston,d1874-1965.tCorrespondence.40uhttp://www.churchillarchive.com/explore/catalogue?id=CHAR%217  aChurchill Archive04395nam a2200505ki 4500001001400000003000700014006001900021007001800040008004100058040002900099043001200128090002400140100004600164245006800210246004600278264009600324300003900420336002600459336003300485337002600518338003600544520248600580588009503066600004603161650004603207651003703253600006103290650004703351651004503398655004003443655003903483655003903522653002503561653002103586653002603607653001903633653001103652653001303663653001403676653001803690653001803708700007503726856006603801975002203867CDCWSCCHAR018UkLoBPm     o  d          acbrdcenhm191104s2012    enka    o     000 0deng d  aUkLoBPbengerdacUkLoBP  ae-uk---  aDA566.9.C5bA2 20121 aChurchill, Winston,d1874-1965,ecreator.10aChurchill Archive :bCHAR 18 : Official : Treasury (1924-1929).30aCHAR 18 : Official : Treasury (1924-1929) 1aLondon :bBloomsbury Publishing in collaboration with the Churchill Archives Centre,c2012.  a1 online resource :billustrations  atextbtxt2rdacontent  astill imagebsti2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aThe Treasury papers contain correspondence, minutes, tables, printed reports, and other papers which were created or accumulated as a result of WSC's activities as Chancellor of the Exchequer, a position held from November 1924 to June 1929. The papers have been divided into general correspondence, WSC's outgoing minutes, and subject-based files and are arranged chronologically. The Treasury material covers WSC's ministerial duties as Chancellor, including the annual production of the budget, as well as specific initiatives from his term in the office: the return to the Gold Standard, widows' and old age insurance, the betting tax and totalisator, rating relief, and the liquid fuel tax; as well as his attempts to reduce government spending, particularly on the navy and army. Specific issues of the period are also covered, including inter-allied debt from World War I, the General Strike, and rising unemployment. The material contains correspondence with WSC's ministerial colleagues and with many Treasury officials, including from the Boards of Customs and Excise and Inland Revenue. It contains much addressed to and dealt with by WSC's Principal Private Secretary, James Grigg. The practice of distinguishing between Cabinet material and departmental Cabinet material has not been followed in the case of the Treasury for two reasons: the Cabinet papers for this period were on the whole carefully preserved together, and it would have been undesirable to disturb this original arrangement, and, secondly, the Treasury is closely involved in the work of all departments, which makes it very difficult to distinguish between WSC the Chancellor and WSC the Cabinet Minister. The series of numbered Cabinet and Cabinet Committee papers, including papers relating to Treasury work have been assigned en bloc to the Cabinet class. Various subject files of this period have been allocated between Treasury and Cabinet according to the tendency of each file as a whole without attempting to break up the individual files, so that in a few cases Cabinet papers and other documents with a Cabinet bearing are to be found in the Treasury class and vice versa. In some difficult cases there is material on one subject in both classes. The carbon copies of correspondence and minutes in the Treasury class are an original series of which some would otherwise belong to the Official: Cabinet (CHAR 22), Public and Political: General (CHAR 2), or even Personal (CHAR 1), classes.0 aOnline resource; description from web page and publisher data (viewed on 4 November 2019).10aChurchill, Winston,d1874-1965vArchives. 0aPrime ministerszGreat BritainvArchives. 0aGreat BritainxHistoryvSources.17aChurchill, Winston,d1874-19652fast0(OCoLC)fst01716876 7aPrime ministers.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01076416 7aGreat Britain.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01204623 7aArchives.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01423700 7aHistory.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01411628 7aSources.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01423900 0aEconomic conditions. 0aEconomic policy. 0aGeneral Strike (1926) 0aSocial reform. 0aSport. 0aStrikes. 0aTaxation. 0aTrade unions. 0aUnemployment.12iContainer of (work):aChurchill, Winston,d1874-1965.tCorrespondence.40uhttp://www.churchillarchive.com/explore/catalogue?id=CHAR%218  aChurchill Archive02708nam a2200457ki 4500001001400000003000700014006001900021007001800040008004100058040002900099043001200128090002400140100004600164245006900210246004700279264009600326300003900422336002600461336003300487337002600520338003600546520092500582588009501507600004601602650004601648651003701694600006101731650004701792651004501839655004001884655003901924655003901963653002402002653001402026653001302040653001902053653001502072700007502087856006602162975002202228CDCWSCCHAR019UkLoBPm     o  d          acbrdcenhm191104s2012    enka    o     000 0deng d  aUkLoBPbengerdacUkLoBP  ae-uk---  aDA566.9.C5bA2 20121 aChurchill, Winston,d1874-1965,ecreator.10aChurchill Archive :bCHAR 19 : Official : Admiralty (1939-1940).30aCHAR 19 : Official : Admiralty (1939-1940) 1aLondon :bBloomsbury Publishing in collaboration with the Churchill Archives Centre,c2012.  a1 online resource :billustrations  atextbtxt2rdacontent  astill imagebsti2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aThe Admiralty papers contain correspondence, minutes, and War Cabinet papers created or accumulated as a result of WSC's activities as First Lord of the Admiralty, a position held from 3 September 1939 to 10 May 1940 when he became Prime Minister.

It includes: private office correspondence; personal telegrams; printed copies of personal minutes, telegrams and reports; correspondence relating to appointments and patronage; some family correspondence (for which see also CHAR 1); and some engagements cards and diaries. No distinction has been attempted between the offices of Prime Minister and Minister of Defence. The former title has been deemed to include the latter. The Private Office correspondence is an original series of correspondence relating to the whole business of Government, which was regarded by the Office as in some sense personal, although distinct from the correspondence of the Personal Office (for which see CHAR 2). The personal telegrams, which survive for 1941 onwards, are the Prime Minister's own copies of individual incoming and outgoing telegrams and often include drafts and annotations. Various printed reports and despatches relating to the war period have been assigned to this class at the end. These reports were produced and acquired by WSC at various times and for various purposes. Some may well have been obtained at a later date for use by WSC in his war memoirs. Other wartime material dating from the period of Churchill's premiership can be found in CHAR 1 (personal papers), CHAR 2 (general political papers), CHAR 7 (constituency papers), CHAR 8 (literary papers), CHAR 9 (speeches), CHAR 23 (War Cabinet papers).0 aOnline resource; description from web page and publisher data (viewed on 4 November 2019).10aChurchill, Winston,d1874-1965vArchives. 0aPrime ministerszGreat BritainvArchives. 0aGreat BritainxHistoryvSources.17aChurchill, Winston,d1874-19652fast0(OCoLC)fst01716876 7aPrime ministers.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01076416 7aGreat Britain.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01204623 7aArchives.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01423700 7aHistory.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01411628 7aSources.2fast0(OCoLC)fst0142390012iContainer of (work):aChurchill, Winston,d1874-1965.tCorrespondence.40uhttp://www.churchillarchive.com/explore/catalogue?id=CHAR%220  aChurchill Archive02469nam a2200397ki 4500001001400000003000700014006001900021007001800040008004100058040002900099043001200128090002400140100004600164245006700210246004500277264009600322300003900418336002600457336003300483337002600516338003600542520083500578588009501413600004601508650004601554651003701600600006101637650004701698651004501745655004001790655003901830655003901869700007501908856006601983975002202049CDCWSCCHAR021UkLoBPm     o  d          acbrdcenhm191104s2012    enka    o     000 0deng d  aUkLoBPbengerdacUkLoBP  ae-uk---  aDA566.9.C5bA2 20121 aChurchill, Winston,d1874-1965,ecreator.10aChurchill Archive :bCHAR 21 : Official : Cabinet (1908-1915).30aCHAR 21 : Official : Cabinet (1908-1915) 1aLondon :bBloomsbury Publishing in collaboration with the Churchill Archives Centre,c2012.  a1 online resource :billustrations  atextbtxt2rdacontent  astill imagebsti2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aThe Cabinet Papers comprise papers acquired or produced by WSC in his capacity as a Cabinet Minister (rather than a Departmental Minister).

This was due firstly to the fact that the Cabinet papers for this period were on the whole carefully preserved together, and it would have been undesirable to disturb this original arrangement, and, secondly, the Treasury is closely involved in the work of all departments, which makes it very difficult to distinguish between WSC the Chancellor and WSC the Cabinet Minister. The series of numbered Cabinet and Cabinet Committee papers, including papers relating to Treasury work, have been assigned 'en bloc' to the Cabinet class (CHAR 22). Various subject files of this period have been allocated between Treasury (CHAR 18) and Cabinet according to the tendency of each file as a whole without attempting to break up the individual files, so that in a few cases Cabinet papers and other documents with a Cabinet bearing are to be found in the Treasury class and vice versa. In some difficult cases there is material on one subject in both classes. The Cabinet papers largely consist of printed papers on issues normally outside the province of WSC's department, prepared by WSC and other ministers. The papers also include correspondence on matters brought (or intended to be brought) before the Cabinet and some manuscript notes which appear to have been written during Cabinet meetings. The papers have been divided into correspondence and subject-based files and are arranged chronologically. A wide range of subjects is covered by the material in this class, including topics such as foreign policy and affairs in foreign countries (including Turkey, Egypt and China), reform of the House of Lords, unemployment, naval policy, the General Strike, and the coal industry. There are papers from Cabinet Committees formed to focus on particular subjects such as the Irish settlement, and regular reports on unemployment, economic affairs and revolutionary organisations in the United Kingdom. There are often indexes to the printed Cabinet papers, and where these exist, the catalogue description includes a note referring to the relevant index.0 aOnline resource; description from web page and publisher data (viewed on 4 November 2019).10aChurchill, Winston,d1874-1965vArchives. 0aPrime ministerszGreat BritainvArchives. 0aGreat BritainxHistoryvSources.17aChurchill, Winston,d1874-19652fast0(OCoLC)fst01716876 7aPrime ministers.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01076416 7aGreat Britain.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01204623 7aArchives.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01423700 7aHistory.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01411628 7aSources.2fast0(OCoLC)fst0142390012iContainer of (work):aChurchill, Winston,d1874-1965.tCorrespondence.40uhttp://www.churchillarchive.com/explore/catalogue?id=CHAR%222  aChurchill Archive02971nam a2200433ki 4500001001400000003000700014006001900021007001800040008004100058040002900099043001200128090002400140100004600164245007100210246004900281264009600330300003900426336002600465336003300491337002600524338003600550520118500586588009501771600004601866650003501912650004601947651003701993600006102030611005202091650004702143648002102190651004502211655004002256655003902296655003902335700007502374856006602449975002202515CDCWSCCHAR023UkLoBPm     o  d          acbrdcenhm191104s2012    enka    o     000 0deng d  aUkLoBPbengerdacUkLoBP  ae-uk---  aDA566.9.C5bA2 20121 aChurchill, Winston,d1874-1965,ecreator.10aChurchill Archive :bCHAR 23 : Official : War Cabinet (1939-1945).30aCHAR 23 : Official : War Cabinet (1939-1945) 1aLondon :bBloomsbury Publishing in collaboration with the Churchill Archives Centre,c2012.  a1 online resource :billustrations  atextbtxt2rdacontent  astill imagebsti2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aThe War Cabinet papers contain mainly printed material, and some notes and correspondence, arising from WSC's positions, as First Lord of the Admiralty, from 3 September 1939 to 9 May 1940, and then as Prime Minister and Minister of Defence, from 10 May 1940 to 23 May 1945.

There are also papers relating to the War Cabinet committees such as the Air Raids Committee, the Restriction of Imports Committee and the War Priorities Committee plus a series of "Foreign Office cables" (copies of telegrams from representatives of the Foreign Office) and weekly intelligence reports.0 aOnline resource; description from web page and publisher data (viewed on 4 November 2019).10aChurchill, Winston,d1874-1965vArchives. 0aWorld War, 1914-1918vSources. 0aPrime ministerszGreat BritainvArchives. 0aGreat BritainxHistoryvSources.17aChurchill, Winston,d1874-19652fast0(OCoLC)fst0171687627aWorld War (1914-1918)2fast0(OCoLC)fst01180746 7aPrime ministers.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01076416 7aGreat Britain.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01204623 7aArchives.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01423700 7aHistory.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01411628 7aSources.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01423900 7a1914-19182fast 0aAir warfare. 0aArmed forces. 0aForeign policy. 0aMilitary equipment. 0aFirst World War (1914-1918) 5aUSSR.12iContainer of (work):aChurchill, Winston,d1874-1965.tCorrespondence.40uhttp://www.churchillarchive.com/explore/catalogue?id=CHAR%227  aChurchill Archive03587nam a2200469ki 4500001001400000003000700014006001900021007001800040008004100058040002900099043001200128090002400140100004600164245006400210246004200274264009600316300003900412336002600451336003300477337002600510338003600536520161500572588009502187600004602282600003202328650004602360651003702406600006102443600004802504650004702552651004502599655004002644655003902684655003902723653002502762653001202787653009402799700007502893700006102968856006603029975002203095CDCWSCCHAR028UkLoBPm     o  d          acbrdcenhm191104s2012    enka    o     000 0deng d  aUkLoBPbengerdacUkLoBP  ae-uk---  aDA566.9.C5bA2 20121 aChurchill, Winston,d1874-1965,ecreator.10aChurchill Archive :bCHAR 28 : Acquired Papers (1690-1960).30aCHAR 28 : Acquired Papers (1690-1960) 1aLondon :bBloomsbury Publishing in collaboration with the Churchill Archives Centre,c2012.  a1 online resource :billustrations  atextbtxt2rdacontent  astill imagebsti2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aThis class of papers was acquired by WSC at various times either by inheritance or gift and has been arranged in groups according to the presumed original owner: Lady Randolph Churchill; Lord Randolph Churchill; John S Churchill; W Bernau of Lloyds Bank and others. The major groups may be broken into sub-series by correspondents and the papers thereafter are arranged chronologically (e.g. Lady Randolph Churchill's letters from WSC are mainly found at CHAR 28/13-28). The series includes a number of letters from WSC himself. Some of the Lord Randolph Churchill papers may have been acquired for WSC's biography of his father but they have been placed in this class because of the impossibility of making a sure distinction. Similarly there are a number of original documents of the period of John, 1st Duke of Marlborough, and some of these may have been acquired for literary reasons. They have been placed at the end of this class together with other documents relating to the earlier history of the Churchill family. Letters explaining the acquisition of the papers have generally been placed with the papers concerned. The papers in this series document many subjects and include, for example, the correspondence between Lady Randolph Churchill and her three husbands, Lord Randolph Churchill, George Cornwallis West and Montagu Porch. There is a long series of correspondence (originally kept by Lady Randolph Churchill) of her letters from WSC. This correspondence documents WSC's schooldays, early military career (there is interesting material relating to the Boer War), and early political career.0 aOnline resource; description from web page and publisher data (viewed on 4 November 2019).10aChurchill, Winston,d1874-1965vArchives.30aChurchill familyvArchives. 0aPrime ministerszGreat BritainvArchives. 0aGreat BritainxHistoryvSources.17aChurchill, Winston,d1874-19652fast0(OCoLC)fst0171687637aChurchill family.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00212093 7aPrime ministers.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01076416 7aGreat Britain.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01204623 7aArchives.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01423700 7aHistory.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01411628 7aSources.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01423900 0aBoer War (1899-1902) 0aFamily. 1aChurchill, Sir Winston Leonard Spencer (1874-1965), Knight, statesman and Prime Minister.12iContainer of (work):aChurchill, Winston,d1874-1965.tCorrespondence.32iContainer of (work):aChurchill family.tCorrespondence.40uhttp://www.churchillarchive.com/explore/catalogue?id=CHAR%228  aChurchill Archive01755nam a2200397ki 4500001001400000003000700014006001900021007001800040008004100058040002900099043001200128090002400140100004600164245006000210246003800270264009600308300003900404336002600443336003300469337002600502338003600528520013500564588009500699600004600794650004600840651003700886600006100923650004700984651004501031655004001076655003901116655003901155700007501194856006601269975002201335CDCWSCCHAR029UkLoBPm     o  d          acbrdcenhm191104s2012    enka    o     000 0deng d  aUkLoBPbengerdacUkLoBP  ae-uk---  aDA566.9.C5bA2 20121 aChurchill, Winston,d1874-1965,ecreator.10aChurchill Archive :bCHAR 29 : Miscellanea (1906-1924).30aCHAR 29 : Miscellanea (1906-1924) 1aLondon :bBloomsbury Publishing in collaboration with the Churchill Archives Centre,c2012.  a1 online resource :billustrations  atextbtxt2rdacontent  astill imagebsti2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aThis class of papers comprises one file of miscellaneous material of various dates which proved impossible to assign to any class.0 aOnline resource; description from web page and publisher data (viewed on 4 November 2019).10aChurchill, Winston,d1874-1965vArchives. 0aPrime ministerszGreat BritainvArchives. 0aGreat BritainxHistoryvSources.17aChurchill, Winston,d1874-19652fast0(OCoLC)fst01716876 7aPrime ministers.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01076416 7aGreat Britain.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01204623 7aArchives.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01423700 7aHistory.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01411628 7aSources.2fast0(OCoLC)fst0142390012iContainer of (work):aChurchill, Winston,d1874-1965.tCorrespondence.40uhttp://www.churchillarchive.com/explore/catalogue?id=CHAR%229  aChurchill Archive01974nam a2200397ki 4500001001400000003000700014006001900021007001800040008004100058040002900099043001200128090002400140100004600164245006300210246004100273264009600314300003900410336002600449336003300475337002600508338003600534520037500570588009500945600005501040650004601095651003701141600006101178650004001239650004701279651004501326655003901371655003901410655003901449856006601488975002201554CDCWSCCHAR030UkLoBPm     o  d          acbrdcenhm191104s2012    enka    o     000 0deng d  aUkLoBPbengerdacUkLoBP  ae-uk---  aDA566.9.C5bA2 20121 aChurchill, Winston,d1874-1965,ecreator.10aChurchill Archive :bCHAR 30 : Obsolete Lists (1921-1952).30aCHAR 30 : Obsolete Lists (1921-1952) 1aLondon :bBloomsbury Publishing in collaboration with the Churchill Archives Centre,c2012.  a1 online resource :billustrations  atextbtxt2rdacontent  astill imagebsti2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aIncludes catalogues and indexes to part of the Chartwell Papers prior to their arrangement by the staff of the Public Record Office between 1961 and 1964.

There are also sections relating to his staff, to private visits abroad and invitations received, and to his racing interests. There is, finally, a considerable number of photographs together with some scrapbook material. Arrangement: The series is arranged in groups in the order given at the start of this introduction. Most of the papers are arranged alphabetically within the files under the names of persons or subjects but the arrangement within the financial papers is generally chronological. Visits WSC made as a public figure are part of the class CHUR 2 (Public and Political: General) although among them are papers relating to a few visits made privately in which important public engagements were carried out.0 aOnline resource; description from web page and publisher data (viewed on 4 November 2019).10aChurchill, Winston,d1874-1965vArchives. 0aPrime ministerszGreat BritainvArchives. 0aGreat BritainxHistoryvSources.17aChurchill, Winston,d1874-19652fast0(OCoLC)fst01716876 7aPrime ministers.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01076416 7aGreat Britain.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01204623 7aArchives.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01423700 7aHistory.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01411628 7aSources.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01423900 0aDomestic animals. 0aFamily. 0aHouseholds. 0aIncome. 0aLeisure time activities. 1aChurchill, Sir Winston Leonard Spencer (1874-1965), Knight, statesman and Prime Minister. 5aChartwell, Kent, England.40uhttp://www.churchillarchive.com/explore/catalogue?id=CHUR%201  aChurchill Archive03360nam a2200433ki 4500001001400000003000700014006001900021007001800040008004100058040002900099043001200128090002400140100004600164245007800210246005600288264009600344300003900440336002600479336003300505337002600538338003600564520160100600588009502201600004602296650004602342651003702388600006102425650004702486651004502533655004002578655003902618655003902657653001202696653001102708653002502719653009402744856006602838975002202904CDCWSCCHUR002UkLoBPm     o  d          acbrdcenhm191104s2012    enka    o     000 0deng d  aUkLoBPbengerdacUkLoBP  ae-uk---  aDA566.9.C5bA2 20121 aChurchill, Winston,d1874-1965,ecreator.10aChurchill Archive :bCHUR 2 : Public and Political : General (1945-1965).30aCHUR 2 : Public and Political : General (1945-1965) 1aLondon :bBloomsbury Publishing in collaboration with the Churchill Archives Centre,c2012.  a1 online resource :billustrations  atextbtxt2rdacontent  astill imagebsti2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aThe files assigned to this series fall naturally into sub-series or groups, most of which derive from an original classification, as follows: Political, P(rivate) and P(ersonal), Visits, Patronage, Gifts, Greetings, Various. Even where there are original series the lines of distinction between them, as between this class and others, could not be made rigid and there are consequently doubtful cases and inconsistencies. POLITICAL: The Political series (CHUR 2/1-139 and CHUR 2/506-517) consists of papers dealing with matters of current political moment though similar papers may also be found in the P and P series. The basic structure of the group is chronological, with an alphabetically arranged main series of correspondence for each chronological period, followed by a number of additional files. These additional files are mainly subject arrangements and are placed chronologically by their earliest date. In some cases the files are formed into sub-series and are then placed according to the date of the earliest file in the sub-series (e.g. the whole of the sub-series relating to defence appears under 1946). Some of these additional files were separated from the alphabetical series because of their bulk at a particular time, and it should be noted that papers under the same head may be found at other dates within the alphabetical series. From 1951 this group is less comprehensive than formerly. For the period 1951-1955 parallel papers were presumably in the Prime Minister's Private Office where they could not be listed, and after WSC's retirement the bulk is naturally less.0 aOnline resource; description from web page and publisher data (viewed on 4 November 2019).10aChurchill, Winston,d1874-1965vArchives. 0aPrime ministerszGreat BritainvArchives. 0aGreat BritainxHistoryvSources.17aChurchill, Winston,d1874-19652fast0(OCoLC)fst01716876 7aPrime ministers.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01076416 7aGreat Britain.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01204623 7aArchives.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01423700 7aHistory.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01411628 7aSources.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01423900 0aAwards. 0aGifts. 0aPolitical patronage. 1aChurchill, Sir Winston Leonard Spencer (1874-1965), Knight, statesman and Prime Minister.40uhttp://www.churchillarchive.com/explore/catalogue?id=CHUR%202  aChurchill Archive03639nam a2200541ki 4500001001400000003000700014006001900021007001800040008004100058040002900099043002100128090002400149100004600173245009100219246006900310264009600379300003900475336002600514336003300540337002600573338003600599520157400635588009502209600004602304650004602350651005002396651003702446600006102483650004702544651006002591651004502651655004002696655003902736655003902775653002502814653002102839653001502860653001502875653001002890653002402900653002302924653001402947653001902961653001402980653001502994856006603009975002203075CDCWSCCHUR003UkLoBPm     o  d          acbrdcenhm191104s2012    enka    o     000 0deng d  aUkLoBPbengerdacUkLoBP  ae-uk---ae-uk-en  aDA566.9.C5bA2 20121 aChurchill, Winston,d1874-1965,ecreator.10aChurchill Archive :bCHUR 3 : Political : Constituency : Woodford [Essex] (1943-1965).30aCHUR 3 : Political : Constituency : Woodford [Essex] (1943-1965) 1aLondon :bBloomsbury Publishing in collaboration with the Churchill Archives Centre,c2012.  a1 online resource :billustrations  atextbtxt2rdacontent  astill imagebsti2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aThis class of papers mainly covers WSC's post-war speeches, from 1945 up to his final years, and follows on from the earlier speeches contained in CHAR 9. Within each year, the papers are arranged in chronological order, and are divided into House of Commons and non-House of Commons speeches. They chiefly consist of speaking notes, drafts, notes and source material, press cuttings reporting the speeches, copies of Hansard and prints. Originally the material for each speech was stored in an individual envelope. For conservation reasons, the papers have now been taken out, and the empty envelopes placed at the beginning of each speech. Subjects covered by the speeches include: General Election campaigns, as fought both nationally and in WSC's own constituency; domestic politics such as the economy, housing, post-war reconstruction, rationing, agriculture, nationalization of industry, unemployment, education and general party politics; foreign policy, including relations with the United States, the Soviet Union and India and the future of Europe; defence, including the organization of NATO, the Cold War, nuclear weapons, rearmament and disarmament; honours awarded to WSC; tributes to WSC's late colleagues; and specific events, such as the Suez Crisis, the Korean War, the 1953 floods and the death of King George VI and succession of Queen Elizabeth II. Where WSC's speeches have been published in Robert Rhodes James's "Winston S Churchill: His Complete Speeches, 1897-1963" the publication details have been included in the description of the speech.0 aOnline resource; description from web page and publisher data (viewed on 4 November 2019).10aChurchill, Winston,d1874-1965vArchives. 0aPrime ministerszGreat BritainvArchives. 0aWoodford (London, England)xHistoryvSources. 0aGreat BritainxHistoryvSources.17aChurchill, Winston,d1874-19652fast0(OCoLC)fst01716876 7aPrime ministers.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01076416 7aEnglandzRedbridgezWoodford.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01290388 7aGreat Britain.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01204623 7aArchives.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01423700 7aHistory.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01411628 7aSources.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01423900 0aEconomic conditions. 0aEconomic policy. 0aEducation. 0aElections. 0aFood. 0aMedical profession. 0aMedical treatment. 0aPlanning. 0aPublic health. 0aTaxation. 0aTransport.40uhttp://www.churchillarchive.com/explore/catalogue?id=CHUR%203  aChurchill Archive02398nam a2200409ki 4500001001400000003000700014006001900021007001800040008004100058040002900099043001200128090002400140100004600164245005600210246003400266264009600300300003900396336002600435336003300461337002600494338003600520520073900556588009501295600004601390650004601436651003701482600006101519650004701580651004501627655004001672655003901712655003901751653001601790653009401806856006601900975002201966CDCWSCCHUR004UkLoBPm     o  d          acbrdcenhm191104s2012    enka    o     000 0deng d  aUkLoBPbengerdacUkLoBP  ae-uk---  aDA566.9.C5bA2 20121 aChurchill, Winston,d1874-1965,ecreator.10aChurchill Archive :bCHUR 4 : Literary (1924-1965).30aCHUR 4 : Literary (1924-1965) 1aLondon :bBloomsbury Publishing in collaboration with the Churchill Archives Centre,c2012.  a1 online resource :billustrations  atextbtxt2rdacontent  astill imagebsti2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aThe papers in this class relating to WSC's second period as Prime Minister are few.

There is one file containing copies of WSC's correspondence with President Dwight D Eisenhower of the United States (CHUR 6/3). There is also a single file containing copies of WSC's outgoing correspondence for the last months of his administration (CHUR 6/6). File CHUR 6/8, apparently relating to the access and custody of war-time Cabinet Office files, was noted as missing in 1987.

His earlier years as MP for Epping [Essex] are covered in the pre-1945 Chartwell Papers at CHAR 7. The vast majority of the papers consists of correspondence handled by WSC's office and local officials, particularly representatives of Woodford Division Conservative Association, including the Honorary Secretaries and Agents Frederick Mummery, and later W Hubert Barlow-Wheeler. They are arranged in two main sections; the first part (and also the final five files) consists of files relating to local events and organizations, such as the Woodford Conservative Association, its officials, General Election campaigns and local authorities. The second, larger section consists of a series of constituents' correspondence, including correspondence with constituency and Government officials on individual cases. These files are arranged alphabetically according to the surname of the correspondent, and also occasionally according to a particular subject or organization, and run in chronological order, although in many cases papers from an earlier date have been brought forward. The files cover standard constituency business, such as WSC's support for various local associations, and a range of local concerns put forward by constituents, including war damage and the resulting housing shortage, the re-development of the Woodford area, taxation, rationing, local education and transport. There are also many letters from constituents on personal matters, such as pensions, National Service (including demobilization), employment and health. In a large number of files, where correspondents give particularly sensitive and confidential personal information relating to potentially living people, some items have been closed on data protection grounds for periods intended to cover the lifetime of the individual concerned.0 aOnline resource; description from web page and publisher data (viewed on 4 November 2019).10aChurchill, Winston,d1874-1965vArchives. 0aPrime ministerszGreat BritainvArchives. 0aGreat BritainxHistoryvSources.17aChurchill, Winston,d1874-19652fast0(OCoLC)fst01716876 7aPrime ministers.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01076416 7aGreat Britain.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01204623 7aArchives.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01423700 7aHistory.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01411628 7aSources.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01423900 0aSpeeches. 1aChurchill, Sir Winston Leonard Spencer (1874-1965), Knight, statesman and Prime Minister.12iContainer of (work):aChurchill, Winston,d1874-1965.tCorrespondence.12iContainer of (work):aChurchill, Winston,d1874-1965.tSpeeches.40uhttp://www.churchillarchive.com/explore/catalogue?id=CHUR%205  aChurchill Archive08689nam a2200469ki 4500001001400000003000700014006001900021007001800040008004100058040002900099043001200128090002400140100004600164245007300210246005100283264009600334300003900430336002600469336003300495337002600528338003600554520684900590588009507439600004607534650004607580651003707626600006107663650004707724651004507771655004007816655003907856655003907895653002507934653001507959653002007974653002807994653002508022653000908047700007508056856006608131975002208197CDCWSCCHUR006UkLoBPm     o  d          acbrdcenhm191104s2012    enka    o     000 0deng d  aUkLoBPbengerdacUkLoBP  ae-uk---  aDA566.9.C5bA2 20121 aChurchill, Winston,d1874-1965,ecreator.10aChurchill Archive :bCHUR 6 : Official : Prime Minister (1951-1955).30aCHUR 6 : Official : Prime Minister (1951-1955) 1aLondon :bBloomsbury Publishing in collaboration with the Churchill Archives Centre,c2012.  a1 online resource :billustrations  atextbtxt2rdacontent  astill imagebsti2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aThis class contains the same type of material as CHAR 8 and is arranged in two parts. The first contains correspondence and the second book-matter. There is a third supplementary section starting at CHAR 4/445 containing correspondence, mainly on proposed films or abridgements of WSC's works, and permissions to quote WSC. The correspondence in this class is largely of the same kind as in CHAR 8. It includes also papers relating to the establishment of the Chartwell Literary Trust, though a few further references to the Trust may be found among the family papers in "Personal" (CHAR 1). The files have with a few exceptions been listed in chronological order; the papers within most of the files are however arranged alphabetically. The above dates (1924-1965) apply to the period when the material was generated or accumulated by WSC; a small number of original older items may also appear in a small number of files. The book-matter is arranged thus: various articles, followed by "The Second World War", and finally, "A History of the English-Speaking Peoples". The basic arrangement of "The Second World War" is by chapters, largely following the arrangement in which it stood. For purpose of description in this list the Cassell's edition has been used, and since chapter titles were occasionally changed in the course of preparation the titles in the descriptions may differ from those found inside the bundles. Since the arrangement of chapters also varied at different stages the present arrangement of papers in chapters is in some cases only an approximation to the final arrangement of the book, and some chapters which did not survive in any complete form have had to be listed separately. Volume 2 Book 2 was formerly Volume 1 Book 3. Volume 1 papers before arrangement consisted partly of a mixture of copy, early proofs, and notes, all of which have been sorted into chapters, and partly of sets of later proofs, some of which are 'Returned Empties'. This description applies properly to printer's copy, whether first copy or corrected proofs, which has been transferred to new proofs. In the remaining five volumes the bulk of the papers were found to be arranged by chapters, and the chapter files, though containing various kinds of copy, proofs, notes, comments, and source-material, are frequently described on their covers as 'Returned Empties'. In all volumes the chapters (and appendices) are followed by sets of proofs at various stages, in most cases covering whole Books or whole Volumes. Some of these are sets sent for commentary by various persons. They are followed by notes, source-material, corrections, etc., but in the later volumes more of this sort of material tends to be absorbed into the chapter arrangement. All the papers which could not be assigned to particular volumes, consisting largely of original source-material, have been placed together at the end of the group. Among the material destroyed as redundant were large quantities of the source-material known generically as 'Gleans'. These are printed copies of original documents in the CHAR and PREMIER groups which were selected for possible inclusion in the work or for background reading. Many 'gleans' survive in the chapter files. The same principles have been used in the removal of original material from the papers of "The Second World War" as were used in CHAR 8. The relationships of the various texts of "A History of the English-Speaking Peoples" are far from straightforward. Work had been brought to an end in 1939 and re-stated in 1946 but it is not easy to see what was accomplished at the latter time. All this early material is therefore described comprehensively as 'pre-war'. When work was re-started again in 1953 a complete set of corrected pre-war proofs was sent for re-setting. After Volumes 1 and 2 had been re-set a later set of pre-war proofs, thereafter entitled the 'New Discovery', was found, and this superseded the earlier work. This 'New Discovery' text, which was re-set and dated November 1954, became the basis of the final version. The relationship of the 'New Discovery' to other pre-war proofs is not clear. Various pre-war proofs were brought forward, presumably in the investigations associated with the 'New Discovery', and these are similar to the proofs surviving among the papers of the Chartwell Trust. They have been arranged by Books and placed at the beginning of this group of documents, followed by the superseded proofs. There is a further set of proofs, in which Book 1 is described as Second Revise, bearing (apart from the Prologue) a series of pencilled numbers which appears printed in the 'New Discovery'. Manuscript corrections on this set are, however, repeated in manuscript on the 'New Discovery', which is also described as Second Revise in Book 1, so that the 'New Discovery' cannot have been printed directly from this set as it stands today. This set, for lack of a better description, has been described as 'pre-war main revise' in the list, and has been arranged by Volumes. The 'New Discovery' proofs sent for printing in November 1954 survive only for Book 1 (incomplete), where they have been placed with the post-war revises, and for some chapters of the present Book 10, where they are filed as 'first post-war revises'. There is, however, a spare set of 'New Discovery' proofs and these have been arranged by Volumes in the same way as the 'main revise'. It should be noted that the work was for some time intended to contain only ten Books, later eleven, and finally twelve. Consequently part of the Book originally numbered 9, dealing with Great Britain in the nineteenth century, became finally Book 10, and the former Book 10, dealing with the United States in the nineteenth century became Book 11. Book 12, dealing with the late nineteenth century, was a late addition. The present arrangement and description correspond as far as possible with the published version, though as a result of the changes described above and others made in the course of the work the correspondence cannot be exact. Volumes 3 and 4 formed originally a single volume 3 and for this reason the 'pre-war main revise' and the 'New Discovery' could not be divided to correspond with the later arrangements. From November 1954 the various chapters underwent a number of revises and all these post-war revises have been arranged by Books. Copies corrected in manuscript have not survived for all these stages. For the book-material those responsible for annotations, i.e. WSC's literary assistants, secretaries, etc., have been identified where possible.
